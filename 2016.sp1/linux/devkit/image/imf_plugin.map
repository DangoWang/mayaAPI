/*
 * When building IMF plug-ins for Maya, we make sure to export only the
 * symbols needed to load and interact with the plugin. In particular, this
 * prevents the plug-ins from exporting symbols coming from static
 * libaries against which the plug-ins are linked.
 *
 * Here's why:
 *
 * Plug-ins are written by separate developers. Each of them might
 * want to use various libraries to implement their plug-ins. At
 * times, it occurs that plug-ins written by different developers are
 * using different and "incompatible" versions of the same library. To
 * support this, we recommend that plug-ins be linked against static
 * versions of these libraries. And, by hiding the symbols of these
 * libraries, we prevent the two incompatible versions of the library
 * from interfering with each others.
